# ZK Archive Verification

Stellar-K8s can verify the integrity and completeness of encrypted history archives without requiring the operator to possess the decryption key. This is done through a **signed manifest + hash-chain** scheme that satisfies the "no-knowledge" property: the verifier reads only a small JSON file, never the encrypted checkpoint data.

---

## How It Works

When history archives are stored in cold storage in encrypted form, a publisher generates an `archive-manifest.json` alongside the ciphertext. The manifest records:

1. **Every checkpoint** present in the archive — its ledger sequence number and the SHA-256 hash of the encrypted file.
2. **A forward hash chain** — each entry's `prev_hash` field is the SHA-256 of the preceding entry's `sequence:file_hash` string, binding all entries into a tamper-evident chain.
3. **An Ed25519 signature** over the manifest body, so the verifier can confirm the manifest was not altered after publication.

The Stellar-K8s operator fetches `{archive_url}/.well-known/archive-manifest.json` and runs three checks:

| Check | Passes when |
|-------|-------------|
| **Signature** | The Ed25519 signature covers the exact manifest body and matches the embedded (or configured) signer key |
| **Completeness** | Checkpoint sequence numbers form a contiguous series at 64-ledger intervals — no ranges are missing |
| **Hash chain** | Each entry's `prev_hash` equals `SHA-256("{prev_sequence}:{prev_file_hash}")` |

If **any check fails**, the Archive Health condition for that node is set to `False` and the failure is reported in the status conditions and Prometheus metrics.

Archives that have no `archive-manifest.json` (plain, unencrypted archives) are treated as passing — the check is skipped automatically.

## Manifest Format

Place a file at `{archive_url}/.well-known/archive-manifest.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "archive_url": "s3://my-bucket/stellar-history",
  "current_ledger": 1048575,
  "checkpoints": [
    {
      "sequence": 63,
      "file_hash": "a1b2c3d4...",
      "prev_hash": "0"
    },
    {
      "sequence": 127,
      "file_hash": "e5f6a7b8...",
      "prev_hash": "sha256(63:a1b2c3d4...)"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "signer_key": "hex-encoded-ed25519-public-key (32 bytes = 64 hex chars)",
  "signature": "hex-encoded-ed25519-signature (64 bytes = 128 hex chars)"
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | integer | Always `1` for this format |
| `archive_url` | string | Canonical URL of the archive |
| `current_ledger` | integer | Latest ledger included in the archive |
| `checkpoints[].sequence` | integer | Ledger number (e.g. 63, 127, 191, …) |
| `checkpoints[].file_hash` | hex string | SHA-256 of the encrypted checkpoint file |
| `checkpoints[].prev_hash` | hex string | SHA-256 of `"{prev_sequence}:{prev_file_hash}"`; `"0"` for the first entry |
| `signer_key` | hex string | 32-byte Ed25519 public key |
| `signature` | hex string | 64-byte Ed25519 signature over the JSON body (all fields except `signer_key` and `signature`) |

---

## Generating a Manifest

The manifest must be produced by whoever holds the archive encryption key. Here is a minimal example using `openssl` and `jq`:

```bash
# 1. Generate an Ed25519 keypair (if you don't have one)
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out archive-signing-key.pem
openssl pkey -in archive-signing-key.pem -pubout -out archive-signing-key-pub.pem

# 2. Build the manifest body (fill in your real values)
BODY=$(jq -n --argjson checkpoints "$(cat checkpoints.json)" '{
  "version": 1,
  "archive_url": "s3://my-bucket/stellar-history",
  "current_ledger": 1048575,
  "checkpoints": $checkpoints
}')

# 3. Sign the body
SIG_HEX=$(echo -n "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha512 -sign archive-signing-key.pem | xxd -p -c 999)

# 4. Extract the public key as hex
PUB_HEX=$(openssl pkey -in archive-signing-key-pub.pem -pubin -noout -text 2>&1 | \
  grep -A1 "pub:" | tail -1 | tr -d ' \n:')

# 5. Assemble the full manifest
echo "$BODY" | jq --arg sig "$SIG_HEX" --arg key "$PUB_HEX" \
  '. + {signer_key: $key, signature: $sig}' > archive-manifest.json

# 6. Upload alongside the encrypted archive
aws s3 cp archive-manifest.json \
  s3://my-bucket/stellar-history/.well-known/archive-manifest.json
```

## Configuring Verification

### Specifying the expected signer key

To pin the operator to a specific signing key and reject manifests signed by any other key, set `archiveSignerKey` in your `StellarNode` spec:

```yaml
spec:
  validatorConfig:
    historyArchiveUrls:
      - "s3://my-bucket/stellar-history"
    archiveSignerKey: "aabbccddeeff..."  # 64-char hex Ed25519 public key
```

If `archiveSignerKey` is omitted, the operator still verifies the signature against whichever key is embedded in the manifest.

Archive health checks (including ZK archive verification) run as part of normal reconciliation whenever history archive URLs are configured — no feature flag is required.

## Prometheus Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `stellar_zk_archive_signature_valid` | Gauge | namespace, name, node_type, network | `1` = valid signature, `0` = invalid or manifest absent |
| `stellar_zk_archive_chain_gaps_total` | Gauge | namespace, name, node_type, network | Number of gap ranges detected; `0` = complete archive |

### Example alert rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: zk_archive
    rules:
      - alert: ZkArchiveSignatureInvalid
        expr: stellar_zk_archive_signature_valid == 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Archive manifest signature invalid for {{ $labels.name }}"
          description: "The archive manifest signature check failed. The archive may have been tampered with."

      - alert: ZkArchiveGapsDetected
        expr: stellar_zk_archive_chain_gaps_total > 0
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Checkpoint gaps in archive {{ $labels.name }}"
          description: "{{ $value }} gap range(s) detected in the ZK archive hash chain."
```

## Troubleshooting

**`stellar_zk_archive_signature_valid` is 0**

- The manifest signature does not match the signer key embedded in the manifest (or the configured `archiveSignerKey`).
- Check that the manifest was signed with the correct private key and uploaded without modification.
- Verify the `signer_key` field contains the hex-encoded *public* key, not the private key.

**`stellar_zk_archive_chain_gaps_total` is > 0**

- One or more checkpoint files are missing from the archive — either they were never uploaded or were deleted.
- Check the operator logs for the specific ledger ranges that are missing.
- Re-run the archive ingestion process for the missing ledger ranges.

**Archive Health condition shows `ZkVerificationError`**

- An HTTP error occurred while fetching the manifest. Check that the archive URL is reachable and the `.well-known/archive-manifest.json` path is publicly readable.

**Verification is skipped ("No manifest present")**

- The archive at that URL has no `archive-manifest.json`. This is expected for plain unencrypted archives. If the archive is encrypted, ensure the manifest was uploaded to the correct path.
