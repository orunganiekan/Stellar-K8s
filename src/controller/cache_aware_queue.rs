//! Cache-aware controller queue backoff and prioritization
//!
//! Standard exponential backoff treats every reconcile key identically: the
//! only input is the retry count. In practice, keys backed by warm/valid
//! cache entries can safely wait longer before the next reconcile (the cached
//! view is still trustworthy), while keys whose cache is cold or thrashing
//! need to be revisited sooner so the cache gets refreshed and stays useful.
//! On top of that, not all keys are equally urgent: a node with repeated
//! failures should jump the queue ahead of a steady-state node that merely
//! missed cache once.
//!
//! This module provides two independent pieces that compose:
//!
//! - [`calculate_cache_aware_backoff`] — folds cache hit rate and priority
//!   into the classic `base * 2^retry` exponential backoff calculation.
//! - [`CacheAwarePriorityQueue`] — a delay queue that only releases a key
//!   once its backoff has elapsed, and among ready keys always releases the
//!   highest-priority one first.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The queue keeps two heaps:
//! - `delayed`: a min-heap ordered by `ready_at`, holding keys that are still
//!   waiting out their backoff.
//! - `ready`: a max-heap ordered by `(priority, insertion order)`, holding
//!   keys whose backoff has elapsed and are waiting to be popped.
//!
//! Every call to [`CacheAwarePriorityQueue::pop_ready`] first promotes any
//! `delayed` entries whose `ready_at` has passed into `ready`, then pops the
//! highest-priority entry from `ready`.
//!
//! Rescheduling a key that is already queued does not create a duplicate:
//! each key carries a monotonically increasing epoch, and stale copies of a
//! superseded schedule are discarded lazily when they reach the front of a
//! heap.
