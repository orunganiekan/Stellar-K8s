//! Structured event taxonomy for Stellar-K8s operator actions
//!
//! Provides a uniform vocabulary of `reason` and `action` strings emitted as
//! Kubernetes Events so that operators can write deterministic alert rules and
//! runbook queries without hard-coding free-form strings.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use stellar_k8s::controller::event_taxonomy::{EventAction, EventReason, EventCategory};
//!
//! let reason = EventReason::ReconcileSucceeded;
//! let action = EventAction::Reconcile;
//! println!("{} / {}", reason.as_str(), action.as_str());
//! ```
